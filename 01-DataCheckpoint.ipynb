    "## Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- How do socioeconomic and demographic factors (income, race, gender, parental education, location) influence a student’s choice of college major?  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Across the University of California system, are STEM majors disproportionately represented at campuses with wealthier or more educated student populations?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operational definitions:**  \n",
    "- *Campuses that are “wealthier”*: Less Pell Grant distribution, less need-based aid.  \n",
    "- *Campuses that are “more educated”*: Fewer first-gen students."

    "## Background and Prior Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are looking at socioeconomic factors and demographics—specifically in the University of California—and their influence on a student's choice of major, one directly relevant study for our question is **“Rich Grad, Poor Grad: Family Background and College Major Choice”** by Leighton and Speer. They used regression models with the dependent variable *chosen major’s earnings growth* and predictors including *parent education/income*. They show a strong correlation between parent education and the type of major a student chooses. Specifically, students with more educated parents are likely to pick “safe” majors with higher early expected pay, whereas students with higher educated parents tend to pick majors that are less safe with slower early earnings. Although there tends to be an association between higher paying jobs upon graduation of STEM-related majors, this paper does not directly address that correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another relevant paper is **“Too Poor to Science: How wealth determines who succeeds in STEM”** by Craig R. McClain. This work discusses financial barriers in STEM such as the costs of after-school tutoring, summer camps, laboratory equipment, and even the expectation to pursue unpaid internships. These economic barriers are a major factor limiting students from pursuing STEM degrees. We can use this article to explore whether economic factors not only limit a student's choice of major but also their potential future earnings within the University of California.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar line of research appears in **“The Changing Role of Family Income in College Selection and Beyond”**. This work narrows the broader question of family income in college decisions to variables of college choice, degree, and post-school earnings. It relates to our project because it examines income across multiple stages of college progression, while our question focuses on whether income affects the choice of major within the UC system. Their research relies on multiple datasets relating income to test scores, college entry, institutional quality, graduation, and regressions (probit & multinomial logit models).\n",

    "**Draft hypothesis:**  \n",
    "We predict a strong correlation between the proportion of STEM majors and the proportion of wealthier and more educated students per University of California campus. Students who come from wealthier and educated households typically have more resources and exposure toward STEM fields. This can appear in the form of extra-curricular opportunities, an out-of-pocket expense that would be less available to those who are need-based."

    "  - Conceptually: one row per **grant award type** (e.g., Pell Grant, Cal Grant A – Entitlement, UC Need-based Grants, etc.) plus a total row.  \n",
    "  - This is likely around **10–20 rows**, but the exact count will be confirmed after table extraction (`df.shape`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Number of variables (columns):**  \n",
    "  - For each award type, the columns include: `paid_dollars`, `recipients_headcount`, `recipients_fye`, `percent_with_aid`, `average_award`, and `per_capita_award`.  \n",
    "  - We will confirm the exact column list after converting the PDF to CSV.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variables most relevant to this project:**\n",
    "  - For the **“Pell Grant”** award row:  \n",
    "    - `pell_paid_dollars` – total Pell dollars awarded systemwide.  \n",
    "    - `pell_recipients_headcount` – number of Pell Grant recipients.  \n",
    "    - `pell_recipients_fye` – full-year equivalent Pell recipients.  \n",

    "    - `total_headcount_2024_25` – headcount of all undergraduates in 2024–25.  \n",
    "    - `total_fye_2024_25` – full-year equivalent enrollment of all undergraduates.  \n",

    "  - Data are **universitywide** for a **single year (2024–25)**, so they do not provide trends over time.  \n",
    "  - There is **no breakdown by campus or by major/STEM**; this dataset alone cannot tell us how Pell students are distributed across majors or campuses.  \n",
    "  - It covers **grants only**; loans and work-study are outside the scope of this table.\n",

    "### Detailed description – UC Universitywide Undergraduate Grant Aid Detail (2024–25)\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset dives deeper into **how grant aid is distributed by award type** in a single year (2024–25). For each grant program (e.g., Pell Grant, Cal Grant A/B, UC Need-based Grants), it reports:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Paid dollars**: the total amount of money distributed through that program in 2024–25 (measured in US dollars).  \n",
    "- **Recipients headcount**: number of individual students who received that award at any point in the year.  \n",
    "- **Recipients FYE**: full-year equivalent count of recipients, which accounts for students receiving aid for less than a full academic year.  \n",
    "- **Percent with aid**: the percentage of all UC undergraduates who received that specific award.  \n",
    "- **Average award**: the average grant amount per recipient for that program.  \n",
    "- **Per capita award**: the average amount of that grant per student when spread across the entire undergraduate population (including non-recipients).\n",
    "\n",
    "For our project, the **Pell Grant** row is particularly important. From that row we can compute the **Pell proportion for 2024–25** (`pell_recipients_headcount / total_headcount_2024_25`), which tells us what fraction of UC undergraduates received Pell in the most recent year in our data. We can then compare this to the proportion of STEM majors in 2024–25 from a STEM-enrollment dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Major concerns / biases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset is both **universitywide** and **single-year**. It does not show how Pell proportions vary by campus or how they have changed over time. This limits us to using it as a detailed snapshot rather than a full trend analysis.  \n",
    "- The table includes **grants only**; student loans and work-study are not part of this dataset. So while it gives a good view of gift aid, it does not capture total student debt or work burden.  \n",
    "- Like the previous dataset, it does not contain any information on **majors or STEM status**; we must combine this dataset conceptually with separate STEM-enrollment data.\n",
    "\n",
    "From an ethical perspective, we must be careful in how we interpret Pell-related metrics. Pell receipt indicates financial need, not academic ability. Any associations between Pell proportions and STEM participation should be framed in terms of **structural and economic factors** (access to preparation, advising, support, and affordability), not as evidence that Pell students are less capable.\n",
