    "## Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- How do socioeconomic and demographic factors (income, race, gender, parental education, location) influence a student’s choice of college major?  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Across the University of California system, are STEM majors disproportionately represented at campuses with wealthier or more educated student populations?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operational definitions:**  \n",
    "- *Campuses that are “wealthier”*: Less Pell Grant distribution, less need-based aid.  \n",
    "- *Campuses that are “more educated”*: Fewer first-gen students."

    "## Background and Prior Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are looking at socioeconomic factors and demographics—specifically in the University of California—and their influence on a student's choice of major, one directly relevant study for our question is **“Rich Grad, Poor Grad: Family Background and College Major Choice”** by Leighton and Speer. They used regression models with the dependent variable *chosen major’s earnings growth* and predictors including *parent education/income*. They show a strong correlation between parent education and the type of major a student chooses. Specifically, students with more educated parents are likely to pick “safe” majors with higher early expected pay, whereas students with higher educated parents tend to pick majors that are less safe with slower early earnings. Although there tends to be an association between higher paying jobs upon graduation of STEM-related majors, this paper does not directly address that correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another relevant paper is **“Too Poor to Science: How wealth determines who succeeds in STEM”** by Craig R. McClain. This work discusses financial barriers in STEM such as the costs of after-school tutoring, summer camps, laboratory equipment, and even the expectation to pursue unpaid internships. These economic barriers are a major factor limiting students from pursuing STEM degrees. We can use this article to explore whether economic factors not only limit a student's choice of major but also their potential future earnings within the University of California.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar line of research appears in **“The Changing Role of Family Income in College Selection and Beyond”**. This work narrows the broader question of family income in college decisions to variables of college choice, degree, and post-school earnings. It relates to our project because it examines income across multiple stages of college progression, while our question focuses on whether income affects the choice of major within the UC system. Their research relies on multiple datasets relating income to test scores, college entry, institutional quality, graduation, and regressions (probit & multinomial logit models).\n",

    "We predict a strong positive correlation between the proportion of STEM majors and the proportion of pell grant recipients per University of California campus. We will quantify these proportions using a Pearson correlation coefficient and an OLS linear regression (STEM % - PELL %). We will compare the coefficient and regression results from UC-wide campus data with individual UC campuses, performing a permutation test with a p-value of 0.01 to determine significance. \n"

    "### Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the U.S. Department of Education College Scorecard – Most Recent Cohorts (Institution-Level) dataset, which contains standardized information on over 6,000 colleges and universities nationwide.    \n",
    "For our analysis, we extract only the variables directly relevant to our research question: the proportion of students receiving Pell Grants (PCTPELL) and the institutional distribution of degree awards across STEM fields. Pell Grant proportion serves as a widely accepted socioeconomic indicator, as Pell eligibility is strongly tied to low-income status.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure how STEM-heavy each institution is, we use College Scorecard’s CIP-based program fields representing the percentage of degrees awarded in specific STEM disciplines: PCIP11 (Computer Science), PCIP14 (Engineering), PCIP15 (Engineering Technologies), PCIP26 (Biological Sciences), PCIP27 (Mathematics/Statistics), PCIP40 (Physical Sciences), and PCIP41 (Science Technologies). These are summed to create a single composite measure (STEM_PCT) indicating the share of total degrees granted in STEM. We restrict the dataset to Bachelor’s degree–granting public institutions using PREDDEG = 3 and CONTROL = 1 to ensure comparability. Additional columns such as INSTNM, STABBR, CITY, UGDS, and MD_EARN_WNE_P10 are retained for context but are not central to the analysis. Together, these processed variables allow us to investigate whether campuses with higher proportions of lower-income students tend to grant a higher or lower percentage of STEM degrees."
