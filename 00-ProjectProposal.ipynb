    "## Background and Prior Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are looking at socioeconomic factors and demographics—specifically in the University of California—and their influence on a student's choice of major, one directly relevant study for our question is **“Rich Grad, Poor Grad: Family Background and College Major Choice”** by Leighton and Speer. They used regression models with the dependent variable *chosen major’s earnings growth* and predictors including *parent education/income*. They show a strong correlation between parent education and the type of major a student chooses. Specifically, students with more educated parents are likely to pick “safe” majors with higher early expected pay, whereas students with higher educated parents tend to pick majors that are less safe with slower early earnings. Although there tends to be an association between higher paying jobs upon graduation of STEM-related majors, this paper does not directly address that correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another relevant paper is **“Too Poor to Science: How wealth determines who succeeds in STEM”** by Craig R. McClain. This work discusses financial barriers in STEM such as the costs of after-school tutoring, summer camps, laboratory equipment, and even the expectation to pursue unpaid internships. These economic barriers are a major factor limiting students from pursuing STEM degrees. We can use this article to explore whether economic factors not only limit a student's choice of major but also their potential future earnings within the University of California.\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar line of research appears in **“The Changing Role of Family Income in College Selection and Beyond”**. This work narrows the broader question of family income in college decisions to variables of college choice, degree, and post-school earnings. It relates to our project because it examines income across multiple stages of college progression, while our question focuses on whether income affects the choice of major within the UC system. Their research relies on multiple datasets relating income to test scores, college entry, institutional quality, graduation, and regressions (probit & multinomial logit models).\n",

    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Draft hypothesis:**  \n",
    "We predict a strong correlation between the proportion of STEM majors and the proportion of wealthier and more educated students per University of California campus. Students who come from wealthier and educated households typically have more resources and exposure toward STEM fields. This can appear in the form of extra-curricular opportunities, an out-of-pocket expense that would be less available to those who are need-based."

    "## Data \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Draft approach:**  \n",
    "The ideal data set for this project would be to look at common data sets(CDS) from campuses across the UC system. Specifically we would be looking at the proportion of students who received the Pell Grant and need-based aid as well as the proportion of first generation students in comparison to how this may affect a student’s choice of college major. We’d be able to collect a large amount of data and observations through the cohorts across all the UC campuses from the multiple academic years that are released publicly. We plan to organize this data and keep it tidy by creating tables keyed by UC campus, year, major, demographic and socioeconomic categories. Furthermore, separate tables can be made for enrollment and financial aid status. \n",
    "\n",
    "https://opa.berkeley.edu/campus-data/common-data-set 2024-2025-CDS.xlsx\n",
    "The two attached links are an example of one data set that we will be utilizing. UC Berkeley, along with the other UC campuses, annually publishes their Common Data Set as an excel spreadsheet with different tabs for general campus, type of enrollment, admissions, student life, financial aid, degrees, and other information like this, which can all be publicly viewed and downloaded without any authorization. So in this, the important variables we want to use are degrees conferred by field, which serves as a temporary proxy for major choices. This allows us to look at closely related measures that correlate strongly with their choice of major, and then cross reference it with another data set of actual admitted majors by demographics, providing the conclusive view for us to analyze the strength correlation between the different data types and our research question. \n"
