# STEM Degree Distribution & Socioeconomic Analysis

## Overview
Analysis of the relationship between low-income student enrollment (measured by Pell Grant recipients) and STEM degree share at U.S. public colleges using the Department of Education's College Scorecard dataset.

## Key Findings
- Discovered statistically significant **negative correlation** (r = -0.107, p = 0.009) between Pell Grant % and STEM degree share
- Contradicted initial hypothesis of positive association
- Result suggests institutional factors beyond income composition drive STEM program emphasis

## Methodology
- **Dataset**: College Scorecard (6,000+ institutions, filtered to 595 public bachelor's-granting)
- **Analysis**: Pearson/Spearman correlation, OLS regression, permutation testing
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy
