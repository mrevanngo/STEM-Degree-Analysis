    "\n",
    "We use the U.S. Department of Education College Scorecard – Most Recent Cohorts (Institution-Level) dataset, which contains standardized information on over 6,000 colleges and universities nationwide.    \n",
    "For our analysis, we extract only the variables directly relevant to our research question: the proportion of students receiving Pell Grants (PCTPELL) and the institutional distribution of degree awards across STEM fields. Pell Grant proportion serves as a widely accepted socioeconomic indicator, as Pell eligibility is strongly tied to low-income status.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure how STEM-heavy each institution is, we use College Scorecard’s CIP-based program fields representing the percentage of degrees awarded in specific STEM disciplines: PCIP11 (Computer Science), PCIP14 (Engineering), PCIP15 (Engineering Technologies), PCIP26 (Biological Sciences), PCIP27 (Mathematics/Statistics), PCIP40 (Physical Sciences), and PCIP41 (Science Technologies). These are summed to create a single composite measure (STEM_PCT) indicating the share of total degrees granted in STEM. We restrict the dataset to Bachelor’s degree–granting public institutions using PREDDEG = 3 and CONTROL = 1 to ensure comparability. Additional columns such as INSTNM, STABBR, CITY, UGDS, and MD_EARN_WNE_P10 are retained for context but are not central to the analysis. Together, these processed variables allow us to investigate whether campuses with higher proportions of lower-income students tend to grant a higher or lower percentage of STEM degrees."
