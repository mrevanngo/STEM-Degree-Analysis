B2,"B2. Enrollment by Racial/Ethnic Category
Provide numbers of undergraduate students for each of the following categories as of the institution’s official fall reporting date or as of October 15, 2024. 

	• Include international students only in the category ""Nonresidents."" 
	• Complete the “Total Undergraduates” column only if you cannot provide data for the first two columns.
	• Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are Hispanic should be reported only on the Hispanic line, not under any race, and persons who are non-Hispanic multi-racial should be reported only under ""Two or more races.""
	• New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data: ""Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-citizens. 
Eligible non-citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the United States (including DACA and undocumented students) and who were not on an F-1 non-immigrant student visa at the time of high school graduation.

More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at https://studentaid.gov/understandaid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens.

Nonresident – A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a student visa or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA, undocumented, or other eligible noncitizens in this category. 
NOTE- Nonresidents are to be reported separately, in the boxes provided, rather than included in any of the seven racial/ethnic categories or in race/ethnicity unknown.

Dual Enrollment: If your institution enrolls high school students in college courses for credit either within a dual enrollment program or outside of a dual enrollment program, you may report the unduplicated count as part of the non-degree-seeking students included in the ""Total Undergraduates (both degree & non-degree-seeking)"" section.

The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection System’s Graduation Rate Survey (GRS).
For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions for the 2024-2025 Survey. https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/survey-components/9/graduation-rates 
In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2017 and Fall 2018 cohorts  (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:

·       Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
·       Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
·       Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
·       Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)

*   Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the ""Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant"" column.

For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the cohort total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).",,

In exceptional cases when a first-time student does satisfy all degree requirements including full credit completion (e.g., typically 120 credit hours) and is awarded a bachelor’s degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term, they are to be considered “retained” for EF reporting purposes.
